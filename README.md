# Software-Engineering-Maximum-Subarray-Sum
Software Engineering(professional elective in my 6th semester in NKUCS) 2nd personal programming assignments.
The work is to code to solve maximum subarray sum problem. The original problem is to find maximum subarray sum of an array, input in console.
## Expansion
- Problem expansion: How about solution in matrix? (done) in 2.5D matrix? (X) in 3D matrix? (X) ...
- Function extension: How about input with files? (done) via the internet? (X) ...
- Data type support: How about mega-size array? (X) element is huge? (X)

## Process Standard
- Use Pylint to check code specification.
- Use profile
- Use unit test
